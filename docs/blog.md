## Introduction

Welcome to my analysis of Airbnb listings in Seattle! In this project, I aimed to uncover interesting insights about the various factors that affect Airbnb pricing and guest satisfaction. By examining a rich dataset of Airbnb listings, I sought to answer several key questions and provide actionable insights for both hosts and guests.

## Questions of Interest

1. How do property types and room types correlate with each other?
2. What are the most common amenities offered in Airbnb listings, and how do they impact the pricing?
3. How does the number of accommodations affect the price of a listing?

## Findings and Analysis

### Summary of Coefficient Interpretation

The coefficients obtained from the linear regression model provide valuable insights into how different features impact the price of Airbnb listings. These insights can be categorized into two main groups: positive coefficients and negative coefficients.

### Positive Coefficients

Features with positive coefficients are associated with an increase in the price of Airbnb listings. Listings with more bedrooms tend to have significantly higher prices. This is logical as properties with more bedrooms can accommodate larger groups and offer more space and privacy. Similarly, an increase in the number of bathrooms is positively correlated with higher prices. More bathrooms improve convenience and comfort, especially for larger groups or families. Listings that offer a real bed are priced higher than those without. Real beds are generally more comfortable and preferred by guests, thus commanding higher prices. Listings with pull-out sofas and futons also command higher prices. These types of beds provide additional flexibility in accommodating guests.

Properties located in specific zipcodes, such as 98109, 98121, and 98119, are associated with higher prices, suggesting that these are desirable locations. The number of guests a property can accommodate is positively correlated with price. Larger properties that can host more guests naturally charge higher rates. The number of guests included in the base price also positively impacts the price. Listings that include more guests in the base price can justify higher pricing. While the number of beds and amenities slightly increases the price, their effect is smaller compared to major factors like bedrooms and location.

### Negative Coefficients

On the other hand, features with negative coefficients are associated with a decrease in the price of Airbnb listings. Listings that offer a couch as a bed type are associated with lower prices. Couches are likely seen as less comfortable and desirable compared to other bed types. Several other zipcodes, such as 98102, 98122, and 98112, are associated with lower prices, indicating that properties in these areas are less in demand compared to those in higher-priced zipcodes.

### Overall Insights

Through this analysis, it is evident that more bedrooms, bathrooms, real beds, and specific zipcodes (98109, 98121, 98119) significantly increase the price of Airbnb listings. Conversely, certain zipcodes (98102, 98122, 98112, etc.) and couch bed types are associated with lower prices. While the number of beds and amenities positively impact the price, their effect is smaller compared to major factors like bedrooms and location. These insights can help property owners and managers understand what features to highlight or improve in their listings to optimize pricing. It also aids in market analysis and strategic decisions regarding property investments and enhancements.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, we gained valuable insights into the factors that influence Airbnb listings in Seattle. Understanding the relationship between property types and room types, the impact of amenities on pricing, and how accommodations affect prices can help both hosts and guests make informed decisions. For hosts, optimizing listings with desirable amenities and understanding market trends can enhance their offerings. For guests, this analysis can aid in finding the best accommodations that fit their needs and budget.
